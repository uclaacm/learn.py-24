        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>During their ten-year quest to defeat the Demon King, Himmel, Heiter the priest, Eisen the dwarf warrior, and Frieren the elven mage built strong bonds. For Frieren, these years were just a brief part of her long life, and she quickly returned to her normal routine of collecting spells after their victory. Over time, as she witnessed the deaths of her former teammates, Frieren realized the depth of her experiences with them and regretted not valuing their time together more. Now, she seeks to understand humans better and build genuine relationships, starting a new chapter in her life.</p>
